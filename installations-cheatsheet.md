# Set up cheatsheet

This document is short list of links to help you set up your environment for editing the docs. Use this reference if you don't need the explanation in [installations](installations.md).

## Setting up your environment

### The basics
You need to have node, npm, git, yarn, and an editor installed:

* Install [node and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm?utm_source=house&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=free%20orgs&utm_term=Install%20npm). For more info, see [docs for node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)


### Install an editor
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (many Angular devs use this). Free.
* [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (Another Angular dev favorite). $$. Limited free trial.


### Optional:

#### Second editor:
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) (good for backing up edits outside of VSC). This isnâ€™t part of the standard workflow, just an app that I like to have in case I feel the need to back something up, especially in cases where git is tricky. Sublime saves even untitled files. 


#### A GUI Git/GitHub client:

* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) 
* [GitUp](http://gitup.co/)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
