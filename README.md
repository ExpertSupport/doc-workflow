# About this doc-workflow repo

We (Expert Support) created the doc-workflow repo to help us learn the conventions used by the Angular team to update the Angular documentation

Originally, it served two purposes: 
* A playground in which we could experiment with learning markdown, git, and GitHub
* Documentation of the workflow we used to manage our daily work

We created a collection of .md files to document various parts of the workflow. 
We discovered the Wiki feature in GitHub and learned that for purposes of documenting our workflow, the Wiki was a better option.
So, we moved most of the information from the .md files into the wiki. 
For a while, we updated the Wiki as we learned more aobut the Angular doc conventions.
At some point, the team became less reliant on the documented workflow and the Wiki didn't get updated to reflect new methods.

We moved all of the original .md files into the /obsolete/ folder so that a visitor wouldn't be confused. 
The only reason to look at the /obsolete/ folder is if you're interested in the history, or if you think there is something missing from the Wiki.
