# Setting Up Your Work Environment

This document contains information to help you set up your environment for contributing to Angular docs. 

You need the following environment setup to work on the Angular docs:

* Github and tools setup.
* Angular.io. repo setup.

## GitHub and Tools Setup

For setting up the GitHub and tools required, see the [Required Installations and Configurations](installations.md) doc.

You also need a foundation in the tools to work on the Angular docs. To learn more about the tools used to develop Angular docs, see [Learning tasks](learning-tasks.md).

## Angular.io. Repo Setup

Once you have configured the GitHub and installed all the required tools, follow the [Angular.io setup](setting-up-angular.md) doc to set up the `ExpertSupport/angular` repo locally for the first time.
