# GitHub playground

The playground is a place for new contributors to the Angular docs who may not have experience with git/GitHub, and who need instructions on how to download and run angular.io, can practice the basics of the workflow.

If you're unsure about how to complete the below steps, see [Learning Tasks](learning-tasks.md).

## Required learning tasks

To learn the git/GitHub workflow, do the following:

* Fork this repo.
* `git clone` your version.
* Create a branch.
* Make some edits.
* Create a new file (markdown) and add to your local repo.
* Add a picture to your file (add your picture to the `img` directory).
* Add a code block to your file. Try HTML or javascript. Specify the language of your code block so that it has syntax highlighting.
* Add two links to your file. Make one link internal to the repo and one external. 
* Push up.
* Create a PR.
* Try squashing a few commits, then push up to your branch again and look at your PR. You should see your squashed commit there. For instructions on squashing, see [Squashing](squashing.md).
