# Set up your working environment

## Required installations and configurations

### Create an account at GitHub
* Go to https://github.com/. 
* If you have an account, log in. If you don't have an account, create one and log in.

### Install Visual Studio Code 
* Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/. 
* Download and install VSCode. 
* Put it in your Dock (mac) or ??(windows)

### Configure the PATH variable so you can invoke VSCode from the terminal
* (mac) Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac
* (windows) Go to ??

### Install node and npm

Node.js is a Javascript interpreter. It enables you to run JS programs locally on your workstation. 

`npm` is the Node Package Manager. It enables easy installation of pre-packaged programs. In particular, it is used to install the dependencies for your local copy of Angular.

* Go to [the npm installation page](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm?utm_source=house&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=free%20orgs&utm_term=Install%20npm)
* Follow the directions on that page.

### (Mac only) Install HomeBrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for MacOS. It enables simple installation of other software. 

1. In Terminal, `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

### Install Yarn

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is the app that enables automatic translation of your Markdown files to HTML for display. With Yarn watching your files, you can edit in Markdown and immediately see the result in your browser. The [Yarn installation page](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) contains more info, including the instructions for installation on other operating systems.

1. (Mac) In Terminal, `brew install yarn`

This assumes you installed HomeBrew.

1. (Windows) ??


### Configure your Finder/Explorer to show hidden files

You probably will want to customize various settings in your environment. Many such settings are in hidden files. By default, the Mac does not show hidden files.

1. (Mac) In terminal, `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES`

1. (Windows)

### Configure a terminal editor, and your email address

You will need a terminal editor for various git tasks such as squashing multiple commits into one or changing a commit message.

vim is the default editor. If you know the vim commands, you can leave it as is.

Alternatively, you can use Nano. It includes the basic editing commands on the screen in case you forget them.

emacs is also an option. We haven't explored that option yet.

You can use any editor you like, including non-terminal ones like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text. A terminal editor is easy because you stay in the same window.

1. (Mac) Edit `.gitconfig` in your home directory with the following:

```
[user]
    email = name@host.com
    name = Your Name
[core]
    editor = nano
```


## Setting up your environment

### The basics
You need to have node, npm, git, yarn, and an editor installed:

* Install [node and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm?utm_source=house&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=free%20orgs&utm_term=Install%20npm). For more info, see [docs for node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)


### Install an editor
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (many Angular devs use this). Free.
* [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (Another Angular dev favorite). $$. Limited free trial.


### Optional:

#### Second editor:
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) (good for backing up edits outside of VSC). This isnâ€™t part of the standard workflow, just an app that I like to have in case I feel the need to back something up, especially in cases where git is tricky. Sublime saves even untitled files. 


#### A GUI Git/GitHub client:

[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) 
[GitUp](http://gitup.co/)
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
